# Random Password Generator

## Description
This random password generator allows the user to create a unique password. It takes in several inputs from the user including length and 4 different options for character types to include. It then generates and displays a strong randomized password based on that criteria. It also includes input validation to make sure the user enters valid data.

This project was a great oppurtunity to learn the difference between alerts, prompts and confirm methods for user interaction. It also tested my skills in loops, string manipulation, and the use of random number/character generation.
